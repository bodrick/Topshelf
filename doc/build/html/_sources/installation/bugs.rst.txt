How to report bugs
==================

If you run into a bug, please spend a minute collecting the right information
to help us fix the bug.

The most valuable piece of information you can give us, is always give us a
failing unit test, if you can't give us that then how to reproduce the bug in a
step by step fashion. Other wise its going to be a lot of back and forth until
we can better understand and get to a failing unit test.
